# Refactoring VBA Code and Measuring Performance
Roselyanne Cepero Santos

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the ability to refactor Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code and measure performance. 

For this deliverable, the author has already done the following as part of Module 2:
    - Create a variable with single or long data types.
    - Write for loops.
    - Write if-then statements.
    - Use design patterns.
    - Use logical and comparison operators.
    - Use an index to access data in an array.
    - Use nested loops.
    - Reuse code.
    - Debug and comment on code.
    - Use visual and numeric formatting.
    - Use conditional formatting.
    - Measure code performance.

## Results
Using images of examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and refactored script.

## Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
